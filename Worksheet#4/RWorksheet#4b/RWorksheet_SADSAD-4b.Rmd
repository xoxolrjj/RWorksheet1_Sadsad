#Using Loop Function

1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in
Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.

```{r}
vectorA <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
matrixA <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

matrixA

 for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    matrixA[i, j] <- abs(vectorA[i] - vectorA[j])
  }
}

matrixA

```

2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown
in Figure
```{r} 
rightTriangle <- c()  
for(i in 1:5) {                                             
   for(j in 1:i+1) {  
      rightTriangle = c(rightTriangle, "*")  
   }  
   print(rightTriangle)
   rightTriangle <- c()  
}
```
3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input
up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
```{r}

 n <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "Enter the number of terms: "))

a <- 0
b <- 1

cat("Fibonacci Sequence:", a, b)

# Generate the sequence
repeat {
  c <- a + b
  if (c > 500) {
    break
  }
  cat(", ",c)
  a <- b
  b <- c
}

```


#Using Basic Graphics (plot(),barplot(),pie(),hist())

4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.

a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of
the dataset? Show your codes and its result.

```{r}

HouseholdData <-read.table("Household.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",", as.is = TRUE)
View(HouseholdData)

head(HouseholdData,6)
```
b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in
Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.

```{r}
male_subset <- subset(HouseholdData, Gender == 'M')
female_subset <- subset(HouseholdData, Gender == 'F')

male_count <- nrow(male_subset)
male_count

female_count <- nrow(female_subset)
female_count


```

c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(),
chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and
its result.

```{r}
total <- c(male_count, female_count)
 
barplot(total, 
        names.arg = c("Male", "Female"),
        main = "The number of Males and Females in Household Data",
        xlab = "Gender",
        ylab = "Total",
        ylim = c(0, max(total)+ 5), 
        col = c("blue", "pink"))
legend("topright",
       legend = c("Male", "Female"),
       fill = c("blue", "pink"))
```
5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:

a. Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of
the chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.
```{r}
monthly_income <- c(60,10,5,25)
 
month_labels <- round(monthly_income/sum(monthly_income)*100,1)
month_labels <- paste(month_labels,"%", sep ="")

pie(monthly_income , 
    main = "The monthly income of Dela Cruz family", 
    col = rainbow(length(monthly_income)), 
    labels = month_labels, 
    cex = 0.8)
legend(1.5,0.5,
       c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellaneous"), 
       cex = 0.7, 
       fill =rainbow(length(monthly_income)))

```
6. Use the iris dataset.

a. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you
have seen in the output.
```{r}
data(iris)

str(iris)

#the str(iris) output gives us a clear overview of the structure of the Iris dataset, including the number of observations, variables, and their respective data types.
```

b. Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length,
sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?

```{r}
mean<- colMeans(iris[, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")])
mean
```
  
c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write
the R script and its result.

```{r}
 
  
pie(table(iris$Species), 
    main = "Species distribution", 
    labels = levels(iris$Species),
    col = c("lightblue","lightgreen","red"))

legend("topright", 
       legend = levels(iris$Species),
       fill =  c("lightblue","lightgreen","red") ,
       title = "Species")


 
```

d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts
and show the last six (6) rows of each species.

```{r}
setosa_lastsix<- tail(subset(iris, Species == "setosa"), n = 6)
versicolor_lastsix <- tail(subset(iris, Species == "versicolor"), n = 6)
virginica_lastsix<- tail(subset(iris, Species == "virginica"), n = 6)
setosa_lastsix
versicolor_lastsix 
virginica_lastsix
```
e. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different
species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal
width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on
the species.
```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
     pch = as.integer(iris$Species),
     col = as.integer(iris$Species) + 1,
     main = "Iris Dataset",
     sub = "Sepal width and length",
     xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width",
     cex = 1.5,
     lwd = 1.5)  
```

```{r}
as.factor(iris$Species)
#as.factor(iris$Species) is a way of telling R that the "Species" variable should be treated as a categorical factor, providing a clearer representation of the nature of the data.
```
##Basic Cleaning and Transformation of Objects

7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black
Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White
Spot).

a. Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.

```{r}

library(readxl)
alexa_file <- read_excel("~/GitHub/RWorksheets_Sadsad/Worksheet#4/RWorksheet#4b/alexa_file.xlsx")
View(alexa_file)

 
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Plus", "Black Plus", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Show", "Black Show", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Spot", "Black Spot", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("Black  Dot", "Black Dot", alexa_file$variation)

alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Dot", "White Dot", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Plus", "White Plus", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Show", "White Show", alexa_file$variation)
alexa_file$variation <- gsub("White  Spot", "White Spot", alexa_file$variation)

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/missy/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/RWorksheets_Sadsad/Worksheet#4/RWorksheet#4b/screenshot.png") 

```
  
b. Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the
object as variations.RData. Write the R scripts. What is its result?

```{r}
library(dplyr)

variations.RData <- alexa_file%>%count(alexa_file$variation)
variations.RData

save(variations.RData, file = "variations.RData")
```
c. From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart
which include the title, color, labels of each bar.
```{r}
barplot(
  height = variations.RData$n,
  names.arg = variations.RData$`alexa_file$variation`,
  col = "skyblue",   
  main = "Alexa Varations",
  las = 2,   
  cex.names = 0.58
)
```

d. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by
side. Complete the details of the chart.

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
 
black_variants <- variations.RData[1:5,]
white_variants <- variations.RData[12:16,]

barplot( 
  height = black_variants$n,
  names.arg = black_variants$`alexa_file$variation`,
  main = "Black Variants",
  col = rainbow(5),  
  xlab = 'Total Numbers',
  ylab = 'Frequency',
   cex.names = 0.35,
 )

barplot( 
  height = white_variants$n,
  names.arg = white_variants$`alexa_file$variation`,
   main = "White Variants",
  col = rainbow(5),   
  xlab = 'Total Numbers',
  ylab = 'Frequency',
   cex.names = 0.35,
)

```
